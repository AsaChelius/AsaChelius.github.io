  The Study Buddy project was an exciting and impactful initiative aimed at addressing a common problem faced by students at UH Manoa: finding a good study partner. This website leveraged the power of Next.js for fast, server-side rendering and React for dynamic user interfaces, while Bootstrap 5 ensured a modern, responsive design. The platform allowed users to create studying sessions, commit to others' studying sessions, and earn points by participating to end up on a leaderboard. By integrating these features, we provided a practical tool to assist students in working together to tackle difficult classes or exams.

  My contributions to the project focused on building key features that defined user engagement. I designed and implemented the leaderboard, which dynamically ranked users based on their accumulated points. I also developed the point system, ensuring fairness and scalability as users participated in sessions. Additionally, I created the logo, which visually represented our project's mission and served as a centerpiece for branding. This experience taught me the importance of seamless integration between functionality and design. I gained a deeper understanding of working with React components, managing state efficiently, and styling with Bootstrap. Moreover, collaborating with my team improved my communication and problem-solving skills as we navigated technical challenges together. Overall, the project was an invaluable learning experience that showcased the impact of teamwork and innovation.
