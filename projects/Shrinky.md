  During my first year as a computer science major at UH Manoa, I joined UH Manoa's game development team in created a single player 2D game. This game is called Shrinky the Clown and was made under the prompt of "jester-like entertainment." The game mechanics are fairly simple: you are a clown that has
the ability to shrink and unshrink itself in order to cross a platform level and avoid the gaze of humans, which would cause a game-over. As a CS major, I mostly focused on the actual coding, game physics apsect of the project and was learning as much as I was actually coding. In the project credits, I 
was credited with the camera control script, which was both simple and complicated to develop in Unity. 
  The camera object would follow the main character but with a certain momentum that felt both noticable but not invasive. In addition to this, I heavily contributed to the game design part of this game.By far the most difficult part of this was to make a game that was fun but also small enough 
to be completed in just three weeks. We had more than a dozen initail ideas on how this game would come together and it took us two whole days to eventually come to the terms with the fact that the coolest game idea is not the most creatable one. Although I had little part in the creation of the 
game art, the art for this game was very well made and the only stipulation that we had about it was the sublte inconsistency that the game art had across artists. The github repository is attatched, and I plan to create larger and better games in the future.
