  I cannot do things that I am not interested in, no matter how hard I try. I will procrastonate or give up entirely before I decide that doing something I don't want to do is worth it. I have gotten around this very problematic trait by simply making everything I don't want to do fun and interesting. 
It is my beleif that you can make anything, and especailly anthing in softwar engineering, fun and interesting. Naturally, this beleif has guided my interests in software engineering to the more entertainment and creativity related aspects of software engineering than anything else. Some of my favorite
peices of software, and maybe some of my favorite things in general, are very creative videogames like Elden Ring or Soma. These famous games incorporate very complex physics systems and other million-dollar peices of software that took developers years to make. However, I know that the software 
engineering team that was tasked with making these games was fully invested into their work because they were massively interested in their fun and creative projects. I would like to have similar experiences in the future with my software engineering career.

  Specifically, I hope to become a better game developer. I have solo-developed several games in my time as a college student, and I can tell you from a first-hand experience that learning the very complex softwares of Unity or Unreal Engine are a breeze when you are invested and somewhat in love with 
your personal project. Instead of having to go out of the way to allocate time to develop intricate collision systems or even to finish the script to a game, the time creates itself. You can't wait to get home just to read software documentation for three hours because you have the vision of your finished
project in mind. In my opinion, this is the only way to go about developing software. 

  I will use this strategy to learn how to develop web-applications, and by the end of this year, I hope to develop my first game in a web application. I hope to combine my creativity and interest in game entertainment with my skills in javascript and HTML to create something that I am proud of that can be 
displayed on my professional portfolio. Additionally, I have interest in learning encryption in regard to how information from severs and clients in transmitted discretely. Ecryption has a long history dating back to when the first computers were built and utilized in World War 2. Learning about how data
encryption has been developed and then cracked and then redeveloped is entertaining and not very difficult to understand because it is made by humans and encryption is very creativity-intensive. I would like to conclude with my belief that becoming a software develop for the sake of money or reputation will
only lead you to a very boring and probably unproductive life. I will avoid this by putting my creative energy into every software engineering project that I work on.
