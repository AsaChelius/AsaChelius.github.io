## Typescript
Typescript is perfect for software engineering. Typescript's base, Javascript, is supported by all major browsers, is capable of asynchronous programing through callbacks and promises, and is as simple as the highest level programming languages like Python. Additionally, almost everyone uses Javascript, the base of Typescript, to make websites, so it is both universal and battle tested. I also like Typescript a lot more than Javascript. I am familiar with Python, Java, C, and C++, and Typescript does its best to bring Javascript back into the loop with the rest of the coding languages. 

I am not a fan of Javascript for the exact reasons that Typescript exists. Typescript is a coding language that provides static typing and other type-based features to Javascript. In my opinion, if you make a coding language too simple, it actually becomes more complicated to use. Microsoft developers noticed that not assigning types to any of your variables causes bugs when you are creating large projects, so they made Typescript. In addition to this problem that Microsoft fixed, however, I also think that the Javascript language complicates coding because all objects do not need to have classes, and there is a lot of shorthand in javascript that overcomplicates the language. For example, I can think of at least three ways to declare the same function. This makes reading code much more difficult. Making objects does not always require a class definition which deviates from normal coding standards much more than I think is made up for with whatever convenience it gives. So, in short, Typescript is an improvement on Javascript, but it is not in my top 3 favorite languages for these reasons.
## Athletic Software Engineering
Athletic software engineering brings a fast paced environment to UH Manoaâ€™s ICS department that is desperately needed. WODs (workouts of the day) test the student on their ability to think quickly with interview-like questions, but more importantly, it motivates the student to learn every aspect of the languages that they are being tested on. Frankly, I have had too many classes in which my learning has been curbed by the fact that the teacher cannot push the students adequately because it will throw off the grade curve of the class. My only stipulation with the WODs is that they need to be balanced with large, long term projects. Long term projects give students the ability to learn parts of the language that are not taught in class, which is not something that WODs traditionally do not force the student to do. To conclude, the added stress of athletic software engineering is worth the great software engineering that it forces me to do.
