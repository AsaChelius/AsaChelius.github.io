## I. Introduction

The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education has significantly reshaped the learning landscape, particularly in software engineering. AI tools like ChatGPT, Bard, and GitHub Co-Pilot have emerged as powerful resources that enhance productivity, support learning, and streamline the development process. Throughout ICS 314, I utilized AI technologies to aid my understanding and application of JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL, Next.js, and web development. My experience with these tools varied depending on the task, and their utility often came with both benefits and limitations.

## II. Personal Experience with AI

1. Experience WODs: For E18, I struggled with writing a function to map and filter an array. I prompted ChatGPT with: "Write a JavaScript function that maps and filters an array based on specific conditions." The response provided a solid starting point, but I still had to adjust it to meet the specific requirements. AI saved me time, but I learned that fine-tuning AI outputs is essential for success.

2. In-class Practice WODs: During practice WODs, I occasionally used ChatGPT for syntax clarification. For example, I asked: "How do I use the .reduce method in JavaScript to sum an array of numbers?" The explanation was clear, and it helped me complete the task efficiently. I avoided relying entirely on AI because I wanted to retain the logic in my memory for timed WODs.

3. In-class WODs: For in-class WODs, I refrained from using AI tools since they required independent work and time management. However, my prior use of AI during practice sessions helped me approach in-class WODs with greater confidence and speed.

4. Essays: When writing essays, such as reflections or technical analyses, I used ChatGPT to brainstorm ideas. For example, I prompted: "How do design patterns like MVC improve software development?" AI provided a structured overview, but I rephrased everything in my own words to ensure originality and deeper understanding.

5. Final Project: In our final project, which involved Next.js and React, I used AI extensively. For instance, I prompted ChatGPT: "How can I integrate a React-Bootstrap navbar in a Next.js project?" AI offered step-by-step guidance, including code examples. Additionally, GitHub Co-Pilot assisted me in autocompleting repetitive tasks like writing components and utility functions. While AI increased productivity, I had to troubleshoot and debug independently to ensure the functionality aligned with project requirements.

6. Learning a Concept / Tutorial: When learning SQL queries, I asked ChatGPT: "Explain the difference between INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN with examples." The response was concise and easy to understand, supplementing what I learned in class. For tutorials, AI clarified concepts that felt ambiguous, making my self-study sessions more effective.

7. Answering a Question in Class or Discord: During discussions, I occasionally used AI to validate my understanding before answering questions. For instance, when asked about "functional programming concepts," I asked Bard to summarize it in simple terms. This gave me confidence to contribute more effectively in Discord.

8. Asking or Answering a Smart Question: I used AI to formulate precise questions for discussions. For example, I asked ChatGPT: "How would you debug a server-side rendering issue in Next.js?" The response helped me ask more specific questions in Discord, which encouraged deeper discussions among peers.

9. Coding Example: When working with Underscore.js, I prompted: "Provide an example of using Underscore.js .pluck to extract values from an array of objects." The example clarified its usage, saving me time from searching through documentation.

10. Explaining Code: I often used AI to explain complex code snippets. For example, I asked: "Explain what this React useEffect hook does and why it includes a dependency array." The response simplified the explanation, helping me understand lifecycle management in React.

11. Writing Code: AI tools like GitHub Co-Pilot were particularly useful for generating boilerplate code, such as creating components or writing loops. However, I avoided relying solely on AI for critical logic to ensure I understood the underlying principles.

12. Documenting Code: When documenting functions, I prompted ChatGPT: "Write a JSDoc comment for this function that calculates factorial recursively." The result provided a clear template that I adjusted to match project documentation standards.

13. Quality Assurance: For debugging, I often pasted error messages into ChatGPT. For example, I asked: "Fix this ESLint error: 'no-unused-vars'." The AI helped identify unused variables and provided clean suggestions, which saved time during QA.

14. Other Uses in ICS 314: Outside assignments, I explored AI for improving my coding style. I asked ChatGPT: "What are best practices for writing clean, maintainable JavaScript code?" This broadened my knowledge of effective coding habits.

## III. Impact on Learning and Understanding

Using AI tools in ICS 314 accelerated my learning process and boosted confidence when tackling complex problems. AI clarified concepts that initially seemed daunting and provided quick feedback on errors. However, overreliance on AI occasionally limited deeper comprehension. For example, blindly copying code without fully understanding it led to bugs that took longer to fix. Overall, AI complemented my learning but required conscious effort to balance dependence with independent problem-solving.

## IV. Practical Applications

Outside ICS 314, I experimented with AI during the HACC (Hawai'i Annual Code Challenge). My team used AI to generate ideas for implementing features in our project, such as integrating APIs and optimizing performance. AI tools were effective in providing suggestions, but human creativity and debugging were crucial for meeting project goals.

## V. Challenges and Opportunities

The primary challenge I faced was verifying AI outputs. AI-generated solutions were not always correct, and debugging errors often required more effort. Additionally, ethical concerns, such as ensuring originality in essays and projects, were a constant consideration. However, AI presents opportunities to streamline repetitive tasks, provide instant guidance, and bridge knowledge gaps, making it a valuable resource for future courses.

## VI. Comparative Analysis

Compared to traditional teaching methods, AI-enhanced approaches offer quicker access to information and tailored explanations. Traditional methods, such as live lectures and discussions, provide structured learning and opportunities for peer collaboration. AI tools excel at addressing individual queries, while traditional methods foster deeper engagement and knowledge retention.

## VII. Future Considerations

The future of AI in software engineering education looks promising, with advancements in personalized learning tools, automated testing, and AI-assisted debugging. However, challenges such as ethical use, accuracy, and fostering independent critical thinking must be addressed. AI should serve as a supplement to traditional learning rather than a replacement.

## VIII. Conclusion

Reflecting on my experience, AI tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Co-Pilot were invaluable in ICS 314. They enhanced my understanding, improved productivity, and provided support during challenging assignments. However, balancing AI usage with independent problem-solving is essential for meaningful learning. Moving forward, I recommend further integration of AI tools in software engineering courses, accompanied by guidance on ethical and effective use.
