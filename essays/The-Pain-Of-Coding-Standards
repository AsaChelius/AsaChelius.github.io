Coding standards are sometimes misunderstood as trivial conventions like how many spaces to indent or whether to place braces on a new line, but they can be much more than that. They serve as the foundation for writing clean, maintainable, and readable code. When used effectively, coding standards ensure that teams can work more efficiently, collaborate seamlessly, and avoid errors that stem from inconsistency or ambiguity. In my experience, the right coding standards can also teach you about the language you’re working with. For example, using ESLint in JavaScript with strict rules not only forces you to write cleaner code, but it often leads you to deeper insights about how the language works, such as scope management, function purity, or avoiding common pitfalls like accidental type coercion.

## Using ES Lint
	
  Having used ESLint in VSCode, my impression is that the tool can be both incredibly useful and a bit painful at times, depending on how strict the rules are and how familiar you are with them. At first, it can feel like a nagging supervisor, constantly pointing out your errors or suggesting changes to things that seem fine to you. But once you embrace the process, you start realizing that it's teaching you good practices. Sure, resolving a bunch of ESLint errors can feel tedious, but I’ve come to see it as a way to refine my code and avoid future bugs. It’s like going through a workout: the effort is uncomfortable, but you see the benefits over time. The pain starts to subside as you get used to writing code that adheres to these standards upfront.

  In the broader context of software engineering, I think coding standards are one of the most effective tools for improving code quality. They help foster consistency across teams and make onboarding new developers easier. The key is balance—coding standards should enhance productivity, not stifle creativity. ESLint is a great example of a tool that helps enforce those standards, but it works best when customized to fit the needs of a specific project or team. In that sense, coding standards aren’t just about nitpicky rules; they are about creating a shared language within the team that makes the codebase stronger and more resilient. So, while dealing with strict rules can be annoying at first, I see coding standards as a long-term investment in the quality and health of a project.
