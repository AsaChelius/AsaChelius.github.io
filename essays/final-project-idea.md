# Gym Tracker: UH Manoa Gym Equipment & Occupancy Monitoring
## Overview

The Problem: Students and staff at UH Manoa often encounter broken equipment at the gym, and it can be challenging to know when the gym is crowded. This lack of information disrupts workout routines and may discourage gym use during peak times.
The Solution: Gym Tracker provides a centralized platform where users can view the status of gym equipment, report broken items, and see the gym’s occupancy trends, helping them plan their workouts effectively.
