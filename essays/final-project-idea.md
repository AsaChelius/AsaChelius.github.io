# Gym Tracker: UH Manoa Gym Equipment & Occupancy Monitoring
## Overview

- The Problem: Students and staff at UH Manoa often encounter broken equipment at the gym, and it can be challenging to know when the gym is crowded. This lack of information disrupts workout routines and may discourage gym use during peak times.
- The Solution: Gym Tracker provides a centralized platform where users can view the status of gym equipment, report broken items, and see the gym’s occupancy trends, helping them plan their workouts effectively.

### Proposers
- Asa Chelius
- Phuong Pham

## Key Features
1) Equipment Status Tracker
- Report Broken Equipment: Users can report broken equipment, adding details like the type of issue, location, and estimated time for repair.
- Equipment Status Updates: Facility staff can update the status once repairs are complete, keeping users informed.
  
2) Gym Occupancy Monitoring
- Live Occupancy Data: A real-time display of gym occupancy levels based on tracking data (from sensors, if available, or manually updated by staff).
- Peak Hours Tracking: Graphs and charts that show historical trends, such as the busiest hours of each day, helping users choose optimal workout times.

3) User Profiles
- Favorite Equipment: Users can “favorite” certain equipment to receive updates on their status.
- Usage Statistics: Personalized data about a user’s gym attendance patterns and peak hours.

4) Admin Features
- Equipment Management Dashboard: A view for gym staff to manage reported issues and update statuses.
- Occupancy Trends: Insights on gym usage for facility planning and improvement.

## Mockup Page Ideas
1) Landing Page
- Introduction to the platform, login options, and links to equipment status and occupancy features.

2) User Dashboard
- Displays the user’s favorite equipment status, personal usage stats, and gym occupancy trends.

3) Equipment Status Page
- Lists all gym equipment, with color-coded indicators for working, broken, or under maintenance. Users can click on items to report issues or view details.

4) Gym Occupancy Page
- Shows current occupancy and provides graphs for peak hour trends.

5) Admin Dashboard
- For staff to review and manage reported issues, mark items as repaired, and update occupancy data if necessary.

## Use Case Ideas
1) Checking Equipment Status: A user checks if their preferred equipment is functional before going to the gym.
2) Reporting an Issue: A user notices broken equipment and reports it through the website.
3) Viewing Peak Hours: A user looks up peak hours to decide when to visit the gym.
4) Admin Review and Update: Gym staff review reported equipment issues, mark items as fixed, and update occupancy data.
## Beyond the Basics
- Notification System: Users receive alerts when their favorited equipment is fixed or when gym occupancy reaches a certain threshold.
- Integration with Campus Systems: Connect with UH Manoa’s student ID system to verify gym access and track attendance.
- Real-Time Occupancy Sensors: If available, integrate with occupancy sensors for automatic updates.
